This is a test post, for testing the static page generation capabilities of LazyPyCMS. Please ignore it. This will basically be a testbed for my odd variant of Markdown. What this will do is allow you to quickly and easily write a post for your site, and then gen_html.py will parse the code and output (hopefully) valid HTML. This means that the Pi that the site is being hosted on will not need to generate pages on the fly - this will only need to be done when a new post is uploaded to the Pi. The script could also be run on a more powerful computer so it takes less time, which would allow the Pi to do even less work after copying the script over via SSH.

Features included in the markup language are:
* Bold, underline and italic
* Bullet points
* Images
* Code
* Blockquotes
* Maths formatting

There is some ^bold^ text, some *italic* text and some _underlined_ text. The \^, \* and \_ characters can all be escaped.
