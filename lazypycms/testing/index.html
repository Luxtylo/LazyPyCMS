            Soldering large hats is something that I love to do, so today I set out to solder a really big one. Nonsense posts make up the majority of the text on this website at this moment in time, which I think is rather lovely. One could say that one is becoming more upper-class as one types this text.<br /><br />
            In fact, the guitar people have sofa leprechaun seven. Once I even had a whole fabric goose for Christmas dinner! It was extremely waffles.

            This is a small preview of what will be in the post, and will probably have a character limit. It'll be about 2-5 lines on the front page, and when clicked on will open the post's page with the whole post. This post has a slightly longer preview than the previous one, meaning it takes up fewer lines, but hopefully it still looks good.
